2D Platform Steve

For the CMU 15-112 Term Project Assignment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:

The name is 2D Platform Steve.The name Steve is a nod to Minecraft in which
the default skin is called Steve, in that the blocks are square, in the same way
the blocks are cubic in Minecraft which is 3D, and also in the way that you can
also build and place blocks. I also included the Platform and the ‘2’ in ‘2D’
because it is a platforming game, and also pays homage to platform racing 2,
which I based many of the different block types off of. I also included 2D
because it is a 2D game. The game will be an arena style platforming game in
which you defeat enemies with a sword and a bow, while also having the ability
to gain blocks to be placed. There are mobs that try to kill you in a variety of
ways, by flying or by moving on platforms.
